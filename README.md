## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox to center the QR code card. I create a flex container with a child element that has the QR code card. I then set the flex-direction to column, and the justify-content to center. This centers the QR code card both horizontally and vertically.
The css code part is as follows:

```css
#qr-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;    
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on using flexbox to center the QR code card. I want to learn more about flexbox and how to use it to create more complex layouts. Also sometimes I am abit confused about margin and padding when adjusting the layout. I want to learn more about them.
